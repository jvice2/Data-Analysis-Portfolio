## Project Overview  

Welcome to my analysis of hurricanes that have occurred in the 21st century! This project aims to identify the most affected areas by these natural disasters based on data sourced from Kaggle. Using Excel for data manipulation and analysis, I explored trends, impacts, and patterns associated with these severe weather events.

## Dataset  

### Data Acquisition  
- **Data Source:** [North American Hurricanes from 2000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/middlehigh/north-american-hurricanes-from-2000)
- **Contents of the Dataset:** This dataset contains information on hurricanes that affect the continent of North America. The columns are as follows:
    - Year - The year
    - Name - The name of the hurricane
    - Category - The category of the hurricane. They are:
      TS - Tropical Storm
      1 - Category 1
      2 - Category 2
      3 - Category 3
      4 - Category 4
      5 - Category 5
    - Rain Inch. - The amount of rain that fell in inches
    - Highest Wind Speed - The highest wind speed achieved by the hurricane
    - Damage(USD) - The cost of damage in US dollars
    - Fatalities - The amount of deaths
    - Areas Affected - The area affected by the hurricane
      
### Data Processing  
1. **Data Import:** Imported the dataset into Excel for analysis.  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Standardized location names and categories for clarity.  
   - Created queries and and pivot tables to assess the economic impact and categorize hurricanes by their intensity.  

3. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends over the years.  
   - Used pivot tables and charts to visualize the most affected regions and compare hurricane frequency and intensity.
