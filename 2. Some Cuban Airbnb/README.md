## Project Overview  

In this analysis, I explore the Airbnb listings in Cuba to uncover insights about pricing and various factors influencing it. Using web scraping techniques, I gathered data from Airbnb, processed it, and performed correlation analysis to draw meaningful conclusions.  

## Dataset  

### Data Acquisition  
- **Web Scraping Tool:** Beautiful Soup  
- **Source:** Data was collected directly from Airbnb's website, focusing on properties listed in Cuba.

   - Listing Price  
   - Location (city)    
   - Ratings and reviews  
   - Breakfast included  

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Created a Pandas DataFrame to structure the data.  
   - Handled errors in the data
