## Project Overview  

This project aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between the population, Human Development Index (HDI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of various countries. 
Understanding how these metrics interact can provide insights into global development trends and the challenges different countries face.  

## Dataset  

The analysis utilizes wikipedia tables about Population, GDP and HDI to make a unique dataset:  
- **Population data**: [List of countries and dependencies by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population  )
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**: [List of countries by Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)  
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: [List of countries by GDP (nominal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal))
- **Countries by Continent**:[List of Countries by Continent 2024](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/list-of-countries-by-continent)

## Analysis
The analysis performed in this project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations of population, HDI, and GDP trends in PowerBI
